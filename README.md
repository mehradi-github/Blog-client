# Connecting the client to GraphQL with Apollo client
The blog-client is built by React (typescript) and [Graphql](https://graphql.org/code/#javascript-client)

## Using Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit TS template](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/introduction/getting-started).

```sh
# Redux + TypeScript template
npx create-react-app my-app --template redux-typescript
```
